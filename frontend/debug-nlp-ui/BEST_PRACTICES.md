# Best Practices for NLP Debug UI

This document outlines best practices for maintaining and extending the NLP Debug UI codebase.

## Code Organization

### Component Structure

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each component should have a single responsibility
   - Break down complex components into smaller, focused ones

2. **Component Hierarchy**
   - Organize components in a logical hierarchy
   - Use folders to group related components
   - Consider creating feature-based folders for larger features

3. **Consistent Naming**
   - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `WhatsAppPreview`)
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

### State Management

1. **Local vs. Global State**
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Only lift state up when necessary
   - Consider using Context API for truly global state

2. **Immutable State Updates**
   - Always update state immutably
   - Use spread operators or `Object.assign()` for object updates
   - Use array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `concat` for array updates

3. **State Initialization**
   - Initialize all state variables with sensible defaults
   - Document the shape of complex state objects with comments

## Styling

1. **Tailwind CSS Best Practices**
   - Use utility classes for most styling needs
   - Extract common patterns to custom components
   - Use the theme system for colors, spacing, etc.

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Design mobile-first, then add breakpoints for larger screens
   - Test on various screen sizes regularly
   - Use the responsive utilities in `src/utils/responsive.js`

3. **Theme Consistency**
   - Use the color variables from `src/utils/theme.js`
   - Maintain consistent spacing using theme spacing values
   - Follow typography guidelines for font sizes and weights

## API Integration

1. **Error Handling**
   - Always handle API errors gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users
   - Log errors for debugging purposes

2. **Loading States**
   - Show loading indicators during API calls
   - Disable form submissions while loading
   - Preserve form state during loading and errors

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Transform API data close to where it's fetched
   - Use the utility functions in `src/utils/formatters.js`
   - Keep components focused on presentation, not data manipulation

## Performance

1. **Component Optimization**
   - Use `React.memo()` for components that render often but change rarely
   - Use `useCallback()` for functions passed as props
   - Use `useMemo()` for expensive calculations

2. **Render Optimization**
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Keep component state minimal
   - Use keys properly in lists

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Consider lazy loading for large components
   - Split code by routes or features

## Testing

1. **Component Testing**
   - Write tests for all components
   - Focus on user interactions and expected behavior
   - Test edge cases and error states

2. **API Mocking**
   - Mock API calls in tests
   - Test success and error scenarios
   - Verify loading states are handled correctly

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes
   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards

## Documentation

1. **Code Comments**
   - Document complex logic with comments
   - Use JSDoc for functions and components
   - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

2. **README Updates**
   - Update README.md when adding new features
   - Document configuration changes
   - Keep installation instructions current

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Update ARCHITECTURE.md for structural changes
   - Document new utilities and services
   - Explain design decisions for future reference

## Accessibility

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Use proper tab order
   - Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions

2. **Screen Readers**
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Add ARIA attributes where necessary
   - Test with screen readers

3. **Color and Contrast**
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast
   - Don't rely solely on color to convey information
   - Support high contrast mode

## Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use the validation utilities in `src/utils/validation.js`
   - Sanitize data before displaying

2. **API Security**
   - Don't expose sensitive information
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement proper authentication if needed

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Regularly check for security vulnerabilities
   - Minimize third-party dependencies

## Code Reviews

1. **Review Checklist**
   - Does the code follow the project's style guide?
   - Are there appropriate tests?
   - Is the code efficient and maintainable?
   - Is the documentation updated?

2. **Constructive Feedback**
   - Focus on the code, not the person
   - Explain why changes are suggested
   - Provide examples when possible

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Use code reviews as learning opportunities
   - Explain complex patterns or decisions
   - Share resources for further learning
