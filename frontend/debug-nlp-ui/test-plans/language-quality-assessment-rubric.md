# Language Quality Assessment Rubric for WhatsApp Chatbot

## Purpose
This rubric provides standardized criteria for evaluating the linguistic quality of WhatsApp chatbot responses across English, Hindi (Devanagari), and Hinglish (Romanized Hindi). It helps ensure consistent assessment during multilingual testing.

## Scoring System
Each response should be rated on a scale of 1-5 for each criterion, where:
- **1** = Poor (Unacceptable quality, requires immediate attention)
- **2** = Below Average (Significant issues that impact understanding)
- **3** = Average (Functional but with noticeable issues)
- **4** = Good (Minor issues that don't impact understanding)
- **5** = Excellent (Natural, fluent, and appropriate)

## Assessment Criteria

### 1. Grammatical Accuracy (1-5)

| Score | Description | Example (Hindi) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Severe grammatical errors that make the message incomprehensible | "आपका ऑर्डर है रद्द" (incorrect word order) |
| 2 | Multiple grammatical errors that significantly impact understanding | "आपका ऑर्डर रद्द है किया गया" (tense inconsistency) |
| 3 | Some grammatical errors but the message is still understandable | "आपका ऑर्डर रद्द किया गया है" (minor gender agreement issue) |
| 4 | Minor grammatical issues that don't affect understanding | "आपका ऑर्डर रद्द कर दिया गया है" (slight awkwardness) |
| 5 | Grammatically correct and natural | "आपका ऑर्डर रद्द कर दिया गया है" (perfect grammar) |

### 2. Vocabulary Appropriateness (1-5)

| Score | Description | Example (Hinglish) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Completely inappropriate vocabulary or terminology | "Aapka samaan cancel ho gaya hai" (using "samaan" instead of "order") |
| 2 | Multiple vocabulary issues that change meaning | "Aapka order reject kar diya gaya hai" (using "reject" instead of "cancel") |
| 3 | Some vocabulary issues but generally appropriate | "Aapka order cancel ho gaya hai" (acceptable but not ideal phrasing) |
| 4 | Minor vocabulary issues | "Aapka order cancel kar diya gaya hai" (slight formality mismatch) |
| 5 | Perfect vocabulary choice for context | "Aapka order cancel kar diya gaya hai" (perfect terminology) |

### 3. Cultural Appropriateness (1-5)

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Culturally offensive or inappropriate | Using overly casual language with formal customers |
| 2 | Culturally awkward or potentially misunderstood | Using English idioms directly translated to Hindi |
| 3 | Culturally neutral but not optimized | Using the same formality level for all customers |
| 4 | Culturally appropriate with minor issues | Slightly too formal or informal for the context |
| 5 | Culturally perfect for the target audience | Perfect balance of respect and friendliness |

### 4. Clarity and Conciseness (1-5)

| Score | Description | Example (English) |

| 1 | Extremely verbose or unclear | "The system has processed your request for cancellation of the order that you had previously placed with us and we have now updated our records to reflect this change in status" |
| 2 | Unnecessarily complex or confusing | "Your order cancellation request has been processed and the system has been updated accordingly" |
| 3 | Clear but could be more concise | "We have processed your request and cancelled your order as requested" |
| 4 | Clear and mostly concise | "Your order has been cancelled as requested" |
| 5 | Perfectly clear and concise | "Order cancelled successfully" |

### 5. Consistency of Terminology (1-5)

| Score | Description | Example |

| 1 | Completely inconsistent terminology | Mixing "order", "purchase", and "booking" in the same conversation |
