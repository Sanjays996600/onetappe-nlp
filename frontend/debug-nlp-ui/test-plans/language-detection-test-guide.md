# Language Detection Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide focuses specifically on testing the language detection capabilities of the WhatsApp chatbot across English, Hindi (Devanagari), and Hinglish (Romanized Hindi). Accurate language detection is crucial for proper intent recognition and appropriate response generation.

## Language Detection Test Categories

### 1. Pure Language Tests

These tests verify that the system correctly identifies commands in a single, clearly defined language.

#### English
- Simple commands: "Show inventory"
- Complex commands: "Generate a sales report for the period between March 1 and March 15"
- Business terminology: "Check the ROI for product XYZ"

#### Hindi (Devanagari)
- Simple commands: "‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì"
- Complex commands: "1 ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡•á 15 ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§§‡§ï ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§è‡§Ç"
- Regional variations: Test with different regional Hindi dialects

#### Hinglish (Romanized Hindi)
- Simple commands: "Inventory dikhao"
- Complex commands: "1 March se 15 March tak ki sales report banao"
- Spelling variations: "Inventry dikhao" vs "Inventory dikhao"

### 2. Mixed Language Tests

These tests verify how the system handles commands that mix multiple languages.

#### English-Hindi Mix
- Hindi words in English sentences: "Show my ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä"
- English words in Hindi sentences: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ inventory ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì"
- Equal mix: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ inventory ‡§ï‡§¨ update ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ?"

#### English-Hinglish Mix
- Hinglish words in English sentences: "Show my inventory ka status"
- English words in Hinglish sentences: "Mera inventory update karo with new prices"
- Equal mix: "Order status kya hai for customer John?"

#### Hindi-Hinglish Mix
- Hinglish words in Hindi sentences: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ stock kitna ‡§π‡•à?"
- Hindi words in Hinglish sentences: "Mera ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•â‡§ï kitna hai?"
- Script switching: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ stock ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡§æ hai?"

### 3. Ambiguous Language Tests

These tests check how the system handles commands where language detection is challenging.

#### Shared Vocabulary
- Words common to multiple languages: "order status" (could be English or Hinglish)
- Brand names and product codes: "XYZ123 ka price update karo"
- Numbers and dates: "12/05/2023 ka report"

#### Short Commands
- Single word commands: "Inventory", "‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•â‡§ï", "Report"
- Two-word commands: "Show inventory", "‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì", "Report dikhao"
- Abbreviations: "inv", "rpt", "ord"

### 4. Regional Variation Tests

These tests verify how the system handles regional language variations.

#### Hindi Regional Variations
- Eastern Hindi: "‡§π‡§Æ‡§∞ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ"
- Western Hindi: "‡§Æ‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì"
- Standard Hindi with regional vocabulary: "‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à?"

#### Hinglish Regional Variations
- Northern style: "Inventory dikha do"
- Mumbai style: "Inventory dikha na"
- Southern influence: "Inventory dikhao please"

### 5. Code-Switching Pattern Tests

These tests check how the system handles different patterns of switching between languages.

#### Inter-sentential Switching
- Multiple sentences in different languages: "Show inventory. ‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì‡•§"
- Questions and answers in different languages: "Inventory kahan hai? Show it to me."

#### Intra-sentential Switching
- Mid-sentence language change: "Show me the inventory ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§ï‡§≤ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§°‡•á‡§ü ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ"
- Phrase-level switching: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•á last month ‡§ï‡•á orders ‡§ï‡§æ status ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§ì"
- Word-level switching: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•á inventory ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç kitne products ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç?"

### 6. Edge Case Tests

These tests verify how the system handles unusual language patterns.

#### Typos and Misspellings
- English typos: "Show my inevntory"
- Hindi typos: "‡§á‡§®‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì"
- Hinglish typos: "Inventry dikhao"

#### Mixed Scripts
- Roman script for Hindi words: "Mera stock dikhao"
- Devanagari for English words: "‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§æ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ã ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã"
- Mixed script in single words: "in ‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä"

#### Emojis and Special Characters
- Commands with emojis: "üì¶ inventory dikhao"
- Special characters: "#inventory", "@order status"
- Punctuation variations: "inventory?", "inventory!", "inventory..."

## Testing Methodology

### Test Process

1. **Preparation:**
   - Create a spreadsheet with columns for: Test ID, Command, Expected Language, Detected Language, Confidence Score, Pass/Fail, Notes
   - Group tests by category for easier analysis

2. **Execution:**
   - Enter each test command exactly as specified
   - Record the detected language and confidence score
   - Mark as Pass if the detected language matches the expected language, Fail if not
   - Add notes about any interesting observations

3. **Analysis:**
   - Calculate pass rate for each language and category
   - Identify patterns in failures
   - Note any confidence score thresholds that seem to correlate with accuracy

### Common Issues to Look For

1. **Misclassification Patterns:**
   - Hindi consistently misclassified as Hinglish or vice versa
   - Short commands consistently misclassified
   - Certain vocabulary triggering incorrect classification

2. **Confidence Score Issues:**
   - Low confidence scores for correct classifications
   - High confidence scores for incorrect classifications
   - Inconsistent confidence scores for similar commands

3. **Mixed Language Handling:**
   - Always defaulting to one language for mixed content
   - Inconsistent handling of similar mixing patterns
   - Threshold for language dominance in mixed content

4. **Regional Variation Issues:**
   - Inability to recognize certain regional variations
   - Misclassification of regional variations
