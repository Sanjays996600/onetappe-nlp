## Color Coding Guide

When transferring results to the final Google Sheet report, use the following color coding:

- **Green** (Pass): Command correctly processed, appropriate response (no issues)
- **Yellow** (Warning): Command processed but with minor issues (low confidence, minor response problems)
- **Red** (Fail): Command misinterpreted or failed to process

### Color Coding Examples

- **Green** (Pass): Confidence score > 0.8, correct intent, appropriate response
- **Yellow** (Warning): Confidence score 0.6-0.8, correct intent but awkward phrasing
- **Red** (Fail): Wrong intent detected, confidence score < 0.6, inappropriate response
