### Resolution Summary

The issue with sales charts not rendering in Firefox has been resolved. The fix addressed several Firefox-specific rendering issues:

1. Canvas dimension calculation problems
2. Timing issues with `getBoundingClientRect()` returning zero values
3. Lack of proper resize handling for responsive behavior

### Implementation Details

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Added container reference to reliably measure dimensions
2. Created a dedicated rendering function to handle all chart drawing logic
3. Used `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` for DOM measurements
4. Implemented `ResizeObserver` for proper canvas resizing in Firefox
5. Added fallbacks to parent container dimensions if `getBoundingClientRect()` returns zero
6. Properly handled device pixel ratio for high-DPI displays

### Testing Confirmation

The fix has been tested and confirmed working on:
- Firefox (latest version) ✅
- Chrome (latest version) ✅
- Edge (latest version) ✅

### Next Steps

- Notify Supriya for regression testing on Firefox
- Monitor for any related issues in future releases
