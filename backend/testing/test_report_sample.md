## Issues Found

### Critical Issues

1. **ISSUE-001**: Product creation fails due to seller_id constraint
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Steps to Reproduce:** 1. Send POST request to /products with valid product data but without seller_id
2. Observe the response
   - **Expected Result:** Product created successfully or clear validation error
   - **Actual Result:** 500 Internal Server Error due to NULL constraint violation
   - **Screenshots/Logs:** None

### Major Issues

1. **ISSUE-002**: Negative stock values are accepted
   - **Severity:** Major
   - **Steps to Reproduce:** 1. Send POST request to /products with negative stock value
2. Observe the response
   - **Expected Result:** 400 Bad Request with validation error
   - **Actual Result:** 200 OK, product created with negative stock
   - **Screenshots/Logs:** None

### Minor Issues

1. **ISSUE-003**: Response format inconsistency
   - **Severity:** Minor
   - **Steps to Reproduce:** 1. Compare responses from different endpoints
   - **Expected Result:** Consistent response format across all endpoints
   - **Actual Result:** Some endpoints return data directly, others wrap in 'data' field
   - **Screenshots/Logs:** None

## Performance Metrics

| Endpoint | Average Response Time (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | 90th Percentile (ms) |
|----------|----------------------------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| GET /products | 45 | 32 | 120 | 78 |
| POST /products | 65 | 48 | 150 | 95 |
| GET /seller/dashboard | 55 | 40 | 130 | 85 |
| POST /login | 35 | 25 | 90 | 60 |

## Recommendations

1. Fix the seller_id constraint issue in product creation
2. Implement validation for negative stock values
3. Standardize API response formats across all endpoints

## Conclusion

The OneTappe API is functional but has several issues that need to be addressed before it can be considered production-ready. The most critical issue is the seller_id constraint violation during product creation, which causes 500 errors. Additionally, input validation needs improvement, particularly for negative stock values. Overall, the API shows promise but requires further development and testing before deployment.
