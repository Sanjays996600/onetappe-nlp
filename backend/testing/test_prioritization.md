# Test Case Prioritization Framework

## Overview

The Test Case Prioritization Framework helps QA teams optimize their testing efforts by identifying which test cases should be executed first based on risk, importance, and other factors. This framework is particularly useful when time and resources are limited, ensuring that the most critical tests are always executed.

## Key Features

- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritizes tests based on business impact and failure probability
- **Efficiency Scoring**: Considers code coverage, execution time, and automation status
- **History-Based Analysis**: Takes into account past test failures and execution patterns
- **Flexible Test Suite Generation**: Creates optimized test suites based on time constraints
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Generates reports in JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats

## Prioritization Factors

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Description | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Business Impact | How critical the feature is to business operations | High |
| Failure Probability | Likelihood of the test failing based on code complexity | Medium |
| Recent Failures | Number of failures in recent test executions | Medium |
| Last Result | Whether the test passed or failed in its last execution | Medium |

### Efficiency Factors

| Factor | Description | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Code Coverage | Percentage of code covered by the test | Medium |
| Execution Time | Time required to execute the test | Low |
| Automation Status | Whether the test is automated or manual | Low |

## Priority Levels

- **P1 - Critical**: Must be executed in every test cycle
- **P2 - High**: Should be executed in most test cycles
- **P3 - Medium**: Execute when time permits
- **P4 - Low**: Execute periodically or when related code changes

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with default settings
python prioritize_test_cases.py

# Generate sample test data
python prioritize_test_cases.py --generate-sample
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Specify custom input and output files
python prioritize_test_cases.py \
  --test-cases custom_test_cases.json \
  --test-history custom_test_history.json \
  --output-json custom_prioritized_tests.json \
  --output-csv custom_prioritized_tests.csv \
  --output-md custom_prioritized_tests.md
```

## Input File Formats

### Test Cases (JSON)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "TEST-001",
    "name": "Test name",
    "category": "product_api",
    "description": "Test description",
    "business_impact": "high",
    "failure_probability": "medium",
    "execution_time": 2.5,
    "code_coverage": 0.8,
    "dependencies": [],
    "automated": true
  }
]
```

### Test History (JSON)

```json
{
  "TEST-001": {
    "last_execution": "2023-06-15T10:30:00",
    "last_result": "pass",
    "execution_count": 15,
    "failure_count": 0,
    "recent_results": ["pass", "pass", "pass", "pass", "pass"]
  }
}
```

## Output Files

- **JSON**: Detailed test case data with priority scores
- **CSV**: Tabular format for importing into spreadsheets
- **Markdown**: Human-readable report with summaries and recommendations

## Integration with Test Automation

The prioritization framework can be integrated with your test automation pipeline:

1. **Pre-Test Run**: Generate prioritized test list
2. **Test Execution**: Execute tests in priority order
3. **Post-Test Run**: Update test history with results
4. **Reporting**: Generate updated prioritization report

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Update test case metadata (business impact, etc.) regularly
2. **Accurate History**: Ensure test execution history is accurately recorded
3. **Balanced Approach**: Don't rely solely on prioritizationâ€”ensure all tests run periodically
4. **Stakeholder Input**: Involve business stakeholders in determining business impact ratings
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine prioritization factors based on project needs

## Example Workflow

1. Define test cases with appropriate metadata
2. Record test execution history
3. Run the prioritization script
4. Review the generated reports
5. Execute tests according to priority
6. Update test history with new results
7. Re-prioritize for the next test cycle

## Known Issues with OneTappe API

The prioritization framework has identified several key issues that should be addressed:

1. **seller_id Constraint**: The `seller_id` field is required but not properly validated in some endpoints
2. **Authentication Token Validation**: Intermittent failures in token validation tests
3. **Seller Order Management**: High-priority tests showing recent failures

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Dynamic adjustment of priority based on code changes
- Machine learning-based prediction of test failures
- Custom prioritization rules for specific project needs
- Visual dashboard for test prioritization metrics
