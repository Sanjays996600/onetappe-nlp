# Test Case Prioritization Matrix for NLP Command System

## Overview

This document provides a framework for prioritizing test cases for the multilingual NLP command system. Proper test case prioritization ensures that the most critical functionality is tested first, maximizing the effectiveness of testing efforts and minimizing risk.

## Prioritization Criteria

Test cases are prioritized based on the following criteria:

### 1. Business Impact

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Critical** (5) | Directly affects core business operations; failure would severely impact users and business |
| **High** (4) | Important for business operations; failure would significantly impact users |
| **Medium** (3) | Supports business operations; failure would moderately impact users |
| **Low** (2) | Enhances business operations; failure would minimally impact users |
| **Minimal** (1) | Nice-to-have functionality; failure would have negligible impact |

### 2. Usage Frequency

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Very High** (5) | Used constantly (multiple times per day by most users) |
| **High** (4) | Used frequently (daily by most users) |
| **Medium** (3) | Used regularly (weekly by most users) |
| **Low** (2) | Used occasionally (monthly by some users) |
| **Very Low** (1) | Rarely used (few times a year by few users) |

### 3. Technical Risk

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Very High** (5) | Complex implementation with many dependencies and potential failure points |
| **High** (4) | Moderately complex with several dependencies |
| **Medium** (3) | Average complexity with some dependencies |
| **Low** (2) | Simple implementation with few dependencies |
| **Very Low** (1) | Trivial implementation with minimal dependencies |

### 4. Language Complexity

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Very High** (5) | Complex language features (idioms, mixed languages, complex grammar) |
| **High** (4) | Advanced language features (complex sentences, regional variations) |
| **Medium** (3) | Standard language features (typical sentences, common vocabulary) |
| **Low** (2) | Simple language features (basic commands, limited vocabulary) |
| **Very Low** (1) | Minimal language processing (fixed phrases, keywords only) |

## Priority Calculation

The overall priority score is calculated as:

**Priority Score = (Business Impact × 0.4) + (Usage Frequency × 0.3) + (Technical Risk × 0.2) + (Language Complexity × 0.1)**

Based on the priority score, test cases are assigned to one of the following priority levels:

| Priority Level | Score Range |
|----------------|-------------|
| P0 (Critical) | 4.5 - 5.0 |
| P1 (High) | 3.5 - 4.4 |
| P2 (Medium) | 2.5 - 3.4 |
| P3 (Low) | 1.5 - 2.4 |
| P4 (Minimal) | 1.0 - 1.4 |

## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Functionality (P0)

Execute all P0 test cases first to ensure the most critical functionality works correctly:

1. Hindi intent recognition
2. Hindi numeric entity extraction
3. Product name extraction (Hindi)
4. API parameter mapping
5. Session management
6. Unicode handling
7. Search_product tests
8. Response time benchmarks

### Phase 2: High Priority (P1)

Execute P1 test cases to cover important functionality:

1. Basic English intent recognition
2. Ambiguous intent detection
3. Intent confidence threshold testing
4. English numeric entity extraction
5. Date/time entity extraction (both languages)
6. Product name extraction (English)
7. Multiple entity extraction
8. Basic command routing
9. Response formatting (both languages)
10. Error handling in routing
11. Message sending/receiving
12. Message formatting
13. Error recovery
14. Intent-specific tests (get_inventory, get_low_stock, get_top_products, get_orders)
15. Remaining performance tests

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (P2)

Execute P2 test cases to cover supporting functionality:

1. Mixed language intent recognition
2. Get_customer_data tests
3. Get_report tests

### Phase 4: Low Priority (P3 and P4)

Execute remaining test cases as time permits.

## Test Case Dependencies

Some test cases depend on the successful execution of other test cases. The following dependencies should be considered when planning test execution:

1. Basic intent recognition tests must pass before testing entity extraction
2. Entity extraction tests must pass before testing command routing
3. Command routing tests must pass before testing WhatsApp integration
4. Basic functionality tests must pass before performance testing

## Resource Allocation

Based on the prioritization, allocate testing resources as follows:

- **P0 tests**: 40% of testing resources
- **P1 tests**: 30% of testing resources
- **P2 tests**: 20% of testing resources
- **P3/P4 tests**: 10% of testing resources

## Continuous Testing Strategy

### Regression Testing

After each code change, run the following tests:

1. All P0 tests
2. Affected P1 tests
3. Automated smoke tests

### Nightly Builds

Run the following tests on nightly builds:

1. All P0 and P1 tests
2. Rotating subset of P2 tests
3. Basic performance tests

### Weekly Builds

Run the following tests on weekly builds:

1. All P0, P1, and P2 tests
2. Selected P3 tests
3. Full performance test suite

## Conclusion

This test case prioritization matrix provides a structured approach to organizing testing efforts for the NLP command system. By focusing on high-priority test cases first, the testing team can maximize the effectiveness of their efforts and ensure that the most critical functionality is thoroughly tested.
