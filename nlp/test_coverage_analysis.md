# Test Coverage Analysis for NLP Command System

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current test coverage for the multilingual NLP command system. It identifies areas of strong coverage, gaps that need to be addressed, and recommendations for improving overall test coverage.

## Coverage Assessment Methodology

The coverage assessment is based on the following dimensions:

1. **Functional Coverage**: How well tests cover the functional requirements
2. **Intent Coverage**: Coverage across all supported intents
3. **Language Coverage**: Coverage across all supported languages
4. **Entity Coverage**: Coverage of entity extraction for different entity types
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Coverage of boundary conditions and unusual inputs
6. **Integration Coverage**: Coverage of interactions between components
7. **Error Handling Coverage**: Coverage of error conditions and recovery mechanisms

Each dimension is rated on a scale of 1-5, where:
- **1**: Minimal coverage (0-20%)
- **2**: Basic coverage (21-40%)
- **3**: Moderate coverage (41-60%)
- **4**: Good coverage (61-80%)
- **5**: Excellent coverage (81-100%)
