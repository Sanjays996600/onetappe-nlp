# WhatsApp Support Guide for One Tappe

## Introduction

This guide will help you effectively use the WhatsApp support snippets to assist beta sellers on the One Tappe platform. The snippets are designed to provide consistent, helpful responses in both English and Hindi.

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Snippet Structure

The support snippets are organized in a JSON file with the following categories:

1. **welcome_onboarding**: Initial greetings and platform introduction
2. **inventory_commands**: Help with inventory-related commands
3. **sales_report_queries**: Assistance with report generation
4. **order_help**: Support for order-related queries
5. **low_stock_alerts**: Notifications about low inventory
6. **error_responses**: Standard replies for common errors
7. **help_escalation**: General help and issue escalation

Each category contains multiple message templates in both English (`en`) and Hindi (`hi`).

### Accessing the Snippets

You can access these snippets through:

1. **Direct JSON file**: Open and copy from `whatsapp_support_snippets.json`
2. **Support Dashboard**: If implemented, access through the dashboard interface
3. **WhatsApp Integration**: Some snippets may be automated in the WhatsApp system

## Using Snippets Effectively

### Language Selection

- Always respond in the same language the seller used to contact you
- For mixed language messages, follow the predominant language
- If unsure, default to Hindi with English technical terms

### Personalization

While the snippets provide a solid foundation, always personalize your responses:

1. **Add the seller's name** when appropriate
2. **Reference their specific situation** or previous conversations
3. **Customize examples** to match their business type when possible
4. **Add additional context** based on their specific query

### Timing and Frequency

- **First response**: Aim to respond within 30 minutes during business hours
- **Follow-ups**: Check in with sellers who haven't responded within 24 hours
- **Proactive messages**: Send low stock alerts and report reminders as needed
- **Avoid flooding**: Limit to 3-4 messages in quick succession

## Snippet Usage Scenarios

### 1. New Seller Onboarding

**Scenario**: A new seller has just joined the beta program.

**Approach**:
1. Send the welcome message from `welcome_onboarding.initial_greeting`
2. Follow up with command introduction from `welcome_onboarding.command_introduction`
3. After 2 hours, check if they've tried any commands
4. If not, send a gentle reminder with the help guide from `welcome_onboarding.help_guide`

### 2. Inventory Management Help

**Scenario**: Seller is struggling with adding or updating products.

**Approach**:
1. Identify the specific inventory command they need help with
2. Send the relevant template from `inventory_commands`
3. Ask them to try the command while you're available to help
4. If they succeed, acknowledge and offer additional tips
5. If they fail, troubleshoot using the `error_responses` templates

### 3. Report Generation Assistance

**Scenario**: Seller wants to generate sales reports but is confused about date formats.

**Approach**:
1. Send the appropriate template from `sales_report_queries`
2. Provide specific examples relevant to their business
3. If they need a custom date range, use `sales_report_queries.custom_date_report`
4. Follow up to ensure they received the report correctly

### 4. Error Handling

**Scenario**: Seller receives an error when trying to use a command.

**Approach**:
1. Identify the type of error (format, missing info, server issue)
2. Send the appropriate template from `error_responses`
3. Provide a specific example of the correct command format
4. Ask them to try again while you're available to help
5. If the error persists, use `help_escalation.bug_report` and escalate to technical team

### 5. Feature Requests

**Scenario**: Seller suggests a new feature or improvement.

**Approach**:
1. Thank them for their suggestion
2. Use the `help_escalation.feature_request` template
3. Ask clarifying questions about their use case
4. Log the request in the Seller Support Tracker
5. Follow up once the feature is considered or implemented

## Communication Best Practices

### Do's

- **Be prompt**: Respond quickly to all queries
- **Be clear**: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon
- **Be positive**: Focus on solutions, not limitations
- **Be thorough**: Answer all parts of multi-part questions
- **Be proactive**: Anticipate follow-up questions

### Don'ts

- **Don't copy-paste** without personalizing
- **Don't use complex technical terms** unless necessary
- **Don't promise features** that aren't on the roadmap
- **Don't ignore parts** of the seller's query
- **Don't delay escalation** when needed

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Frustrated Sellers

1. Acknowledge their frustration
2. Apologize for the inconvenience
3. Focus on concrete next steps
4. Offer to escalate if needed
5. Follow up personally after resolution

### Technical Issues Beyond Your Knowledge

1. Be honest about not knowing the answer
2. Use `help_escalation.human_support` template
3. Collect all relevant details
4. Escalate to technical team
5. Keep the seller informed about progress

### Multiple Issues in One Conversation

1. Address the most critical issue first
2. Organize your response by topic
3. Use numbered lists for clarity
4. Confirm which issues are resolved
5. Create separate tracker entries for each issue

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to evaluate your support effectiveness:

1. **Response time**: How quickly you respond to queries
2. **Resolution time**: How long it takes to resolve issues
3. **First-contact resolution rate**: Issues resolved without escalation
4. **Customer satisfaction**: Feedback from sellers
5. **Command adoption**: Increase in command usage after support

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Document new issues** not covered by existing snippets
2. **Suggest new snippets** for common scenarios
3. **Report unclear or ineffective snippets**
4. **Share success stories** with the team
5. **Contribute to knowledge base** for future reference

Remember that while these snippets provide a framework, your personal touch and understanding of each seller's unique situation are what will make your support truly effective. Use the snippets as a starting point, but always adapt them to the specific context of the conversation.
