# NLP Command System Security Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the security testing strategy for the NLP command system, focusing on identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities in the multilingual command processing pipeline and its integrations.

## Security Testing Goals

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Discover potential security weaknesses in the NLP command system
2. **Prevent Data Leakage**: Ensure sensitive information is properly protected
3. **Validate Authentication**: Verify that access controls are properly implemented
4. **Ensure Input Validation**: Test system resilience against malicious inputs
5. **Verify API Security**: Ensure API endpoints are protected against common attacks

## Security Testing Scope

### In Scope
- NLP command parsing and processing
- WhatsApp integration
- API endpoints and authentication
- Data handling and storage
- Error handling and logging
- Input validation

### Out of Scope
- Underlying infrastructure security (servers, networks)
- Physical security
- Third-party service security (beyond integration points)

## Security Test Types

### 1. Input Validation Testing

#### Objective
Verify that the NLP system properly validates and sanitizes all inputs to prevent injection attacks and other input-based vulnerabilities.

#### Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| IV-01 | Command Injection | Test commands with shell metacharacters (e.g., `; ls -la`) | Command should be treated as text, not executed |
| IV-02 | SQL Injection | Test commands with SQL injection patterns | No database exposure or errors |
| IV-03 | Cross-Site Scripting | Test commands with JavaScript/HTML tags | Tags should be treated as text, not executed |
| IV-04 | Oversized Input | Test extremely long commands (10,000+ characters) | Graceful handling without crashes |
| IV-05 | Special Characters | Test commands with special Unicode characters | Proper handling without errors |
| IV-06 | Null Bytes | Test commands containing null bytes | Proper rejection or sanitization |

### 2. Authentication and Authorization Testing

#### Objective
Verify that the system properly authenticates users and enforces appropriate access controls.

#### Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| AA-01 | WhatsApp Authentication | Verify WhatsApp message authentication | Only authenticated messages processed |
| AA-02 | API Authentication | Test API endpoints with invalid credentials | Access denied with appropriate error |
| AA-03 | Session Management | Test session timeout and invalidation | Sessions expire appropriately |
| AA-04 | Privilege Escalation | Attempt to access admin functions as regular user | Access denied |
| AA-05 | Brute Force Protection | Attempt multiple failed authentications | Rate limiting or account lockout |

### 3. Data Protection Testing

#### Objective
Verify that sensitive data is properly protected throughout the system.

#### Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| DP-01 | Sensitive Data in Logs | Check logs for sensitive information | No sensitive data in logs |
| DP-02 | Data Encryption | Verify encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest | Data properly encrypted |
| DP-03 | Error Messages | Trigger errors and check for information disclosure | No sensitive information in error messages |
| DP-04 | Cache Security | Check for sensitive data in caches | No sensitive data cached inappropriately |
| DP-05 | Data Retention | Verify data retention policies are enforced | Data deleted according to policy |

### 4. API Security Testing

#### Objective
Verify that API endpoints are secure against common attacks.

#### Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| API-01 | Rate Limiting | Send excessive requests to API endpoints | Requests throttled after threshold |
| API-02 | HTTPS Enforcement | Attempt connections over HTTP | Redirect to HTTPS or connection refused |
| API-03 | CORS Configuration | Test cross-origin requests | Proper CORS headers and restrictions |
| API-04 | HTTP Method Restrictions | Test inappropriate HTTP methods | Methods properly restricted |
| API-05 | API Parameter Tampering | Modify API parameters to access unauthorized data | Access denied |

### 5. Error Handling and Logging Testing

#### Objective
Verify that errors are handled securely and logging is appropriate.

#### Test Cases

| ID | Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| EL-01 | Error Suppression | Trigger errors and check if they're properly caught | No unhandled exceptions |
| EL-02 | Log Injection | Attempt to inject malicious content into logs | Log entries properly sanitized |
| EL-03 | Log Access Control | Verify access controls on log files | Logs accessible only to authorized users |
| EL-04 | Log Completeness | Verify security events are properly logged | Security events captured in logs |

## Security Testing Tools

                response = route_command(parsed_result)

                self.assertNotIn("SQL", response)
                self.assertNotIn("database", response.lower())

            parsed_result = parse_multilingual_command(long_command)
            
            # Verify the system didn't crash
            self.assertIsNotNone(parsed_result)
