# Performance Testing Plan for NLP Command System

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive performance testing strategy for the multilingual NLP command system. Performance testing is essential to ensure the system can handle expected loads, respond within acceptable timeframes, and scale appropriately as usage grows. Given the real-time nature of WhatsApp interactions and the complexity of NLP processing, performance is a critical quality attribute for user satisfaction.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Validate Response Time**: Ensure the system responds to user commands within acceptable timeframes
2. **Verify Throughput**: Confirm the system can handle the expected volume of concurrent commands
3. **Assess Scalability**: Determine how the system performs under increasing loads
4. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Locate performance constraints in the system architecture
5. **Establish Baselines**: Create performance benchmarks for future comparison

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Command Processing Time | < 1.5 seconds | > 3 seconds |
| NLP Intent Recognition Time | < 500 ms | > 1 second |
| Entity Extraction Time | < 300 ms | > 800 ms |
| API Response Time | < 700 ms | > 2 seconds |
| WhatsApp Message Delivery | < 2 seconds | > 5 seconds |
| System Throughput | > 50 commands/minute | < 20 commands/minute |
| CPU Utilization | < 70% | > 90% |
| Memory Usage | < 80% | > 95% |

## Performance Test Types

### 1. Load Testing

**Objective**: Verify system behavior under expected and peak load conditions.

**Approach**:
- Simulate normal user load (e.g., 20 concurrent users)
- Simulate peak load (e.g., 50 concurrent users)
- Maintain the load for an extended period (e.g., 1 hour)
- Monitor response times, throughput, and resource utilization

**Key Scenarios**:
- Multiple users sending commands simultaneously
- Mix of different command types (search, reports, inventory, etc.)
- Commands in different languages (English and Hindi)

### 2. Stress Testing

**Objective**: Identify the breaking point of the system and understand failure modes.

**Approach**:
- Gradually increase load beyond expected peak levels
- Continue until system performance degrades significantly
- Identify the maximum capacity of the system
- Observe system behavior during recovery

**Key Scenarios**:
- Rapid increase in concurrent users
- Burst of commands in short timeframes
- Complex commands requiring extensive processing

### 3. Endurance Testing

**Objective**: Verify system stability over extended periods of operation.

**Approach**:
- Maintain moderate load for an extended period (e.g., 24 hours)
- Monitor for memory leaks, resource depletion, or performance degradation
- Observe system behavior after extended operation

**Key Scenarios**:
- Continuous command processing
- Periodic peaks in command volume
- Mix of simple and complex commands

### 4. Spike Testing

**Objective**: Evaluate system response to sudden increases in load.

**Approach**:
- Introduce sudden spikes in user activity
- Observe system response and recovery
- Verify that performance returns to normal after spikes

**Key Scenarios**:
- Sudden increase in users (e.g., 5x normal load)
- Burst of similar commands (e.g., many users requesting reports simultaneously)
- Recovery period after spike

### 5. Scalability Testing

**Objective**: Determine how the system scales with increasing resources.

**Approach**:
- Test with varying resource allocations (CPU, memory, instances)
- Measure performance improvements with additional resources
- Identify scaling limitations and bottlenecks

**Key Scenarios**:
- Horizontal scaling (adding more instances)
- Vertical scaling (increasing resources per instance)
- Database scaling

## Test Environment
