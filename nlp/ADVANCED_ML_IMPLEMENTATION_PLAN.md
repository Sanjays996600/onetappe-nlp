# Advanced ML Implementation Plan for Multilingual NLP System

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for enhancing the current rule-based multilingual NLP system with advanced machine learning capabilities to improve accuracy, scalability, and language support.

## Current System Assessment

The current system uses primarily rule-based approaches with:
