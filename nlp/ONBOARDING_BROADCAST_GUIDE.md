# WhatsApp Onboarding Broadcast Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions for using the WhatsApp onboarding broadcast templates to effectively invite and onboard new sellers to the One Tappe beta program. The templates are designed to create interest, highlight key features, and drive action.

## Broadcast Templates Overview

The onboarding broadcast sequence consists of three carefully crafted messages:

1. **Initial Invitation**: Introduces One Tappe and extends the beta invitation
2. **Feature Highlight**: Showcases key benefits and features
3. **Action Required**: Creates urgency and provides clear next steps

Each template is available in both English and Hindi to accommodate seller preferences.

## When to Send Each Message

### Timing Strategy

For optimal engagement, follow this sending schedule:

1. **Initial Invitation**: Day 1 (Tuesday or Wednesday, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
2. **Feature Highlight**: Day 1 (Same day, 4-6 hours after initial message)
3. **Action Required**: Day 2 (Next day, same time as initial message)

This spacing allows sellers to process the information without feeling overwhelmed, while maintaining momentum.

### Optimal Timing

- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times**: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- **Avoid**: Weekends, early mornings, late evenings
- **Consider**: Local business hours for different regions

## Customization Guidelines

### Essential Personalization

Always customize these elements in the templates:

1. **Seller Name**: Replace `[Seller Name]` with the actual business or owner name
2. **Business Type References**: Tailor examples to match their business category when possible

### Optional Customization

Consider these additional customizations for higher engagement:

1. **Local References**: Mention nearby landmarks or local context
2. **Specific Pain Points**: Address known challenges for their business type
3. **Testimonials**: Add brief quotes from similar businesses (once available)

## Segmentation Strategy

For more effective outreach, segment your broadcast lists:

1. **By Business Type**: Retail, service, food & beverage, etc.
2. **By Location**: Urban, suburban, rural
3. **By Size**: Small (1-2 people), medium (3-10), large (10+)
4. **By Tech Comfort**: Based on previous digital tool adoption

Tailor your message emphasis based on segment needs.

## Response Handling

### Positive Responses

When a seller responds positively (says "YES" or "‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç"):

1. Respond within 30 minutes during business hours
2. Use the welcome templates from `whatsapp_support_snippets.json`
3. Schedule a personal onboarding call if needed
4. Add them to the active beta users list

### Questions or Concerns

When a seller has questions before committing:

1. Address specific concerns directly
2. Offer to schedule a call for detailed explanation
3. Share relevant success stories (once available)
4. Follow up within 24 hours if no response

### Negative or No Responses

For sellers who decline or don't respond:

1. For explicit "no" - thank them and keep the door open for future
2. For no response - follow up once after 3 days
3. Add to a "retry later" list for future campaigns
4. Note any specific objections for product improvement

## Tracking and Measurement

Track these metrics for each broadcast campaign:

1. **Delivery Rate**: % of messages successfully delivered
2. **Open Rate**: % of messages read (blue ticks)
3. **Response Rate**: % of sellers who replied
4. **Conversion Rate**: % of sellers who joined the beta
5. **Time to Response**: Average time until seller response

Document these in a separate tracking sheet.

4. **Gather Feedback**: Note common questions to improve future broadcasts
5. **Iterate**: Refine messages based on response rates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Sending Too Many Messages**: Limit to 3-4 messages per week
2. **Generic Messaging**: Always personalize key elements
3. **Poor Timing**: Avoid sending during busy business hours
4. **Ignoring Responses**: Ensure quick follow-up to all replies
5. **Technical Language**: Keep messages simple and benefit-focused

## WhatsApp Business Policy Compliance

Ensure all broadcasts comply with WhatsApp Business policies:

1. **Opt-in Required**: Only message sellers who have agreed to be contacted
2. **Provide Value**: Each message should offer clear value
3. **Honor Opt-outs**: Respect requests to stop receiving messages
4. **Avoid Spam Patterns**: Don't send identical messages repeatedly
5. **Quality Content**: Ensure messages are relevant and well-formatted
