The Seller Support Tracker is a crucial tool for managing and resolving issues reported by beta sellers using the One Tappe platform. This guide explains how to effectively use and maintain the tracker.

## Tracker Fields

- **Complaint**: Negative feedback or dissatisfaction

### 4. Description
- Provide a clear, concise summary of the issue
- Include relevant details such as:
  - Exact command used (if applicable)
  - Error messages received
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Screenshots (link to cloud storage if needed)

### 5. Status

- **Resolved**: Issue has been fixed or addressed
- **Escalated**: Forwarded to technical team or management
- **Awaiting Seller Response**: Waiting for additional information

### 6. Assigned To

### 8. Timestamp

## Using the Tracker

### Setting Up

1. Import the CSV template into Google Sheets
2. Set up data validation for the Status and Issue Type columns
3. Enable filters to easily sort and find issues
4. Share the sheet with all relevant team members

### Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Review (9:00 AM)**
   - Check for new unassigned issues
   - Follow up on pending issues from previous day

2. **Throughout the Day**
   - Update statuses as issues progress
   - Add new issues as they come in
   - Escalate issues that cannot be resolved at your level

3. **End of Day (6:00 PM)**
   - Ensure all issues have been updated
   - Identify priority issues for the next day
   - Generate a daily summary report

### Prioritization Guidelines

Use these guidelines to prioritize issues:

**High Priority**
- Platform not working for multiple sellers
- Critical business functions affected (e.g., cannot add products, view inventory)
- Data loss or security concerns

**Medium Priority**
- Functionality issues affecting single seller
- Report generation problems
- UI/UX issues that impact usability

**Low Priority**
- Feature requests
- Minor UI/UX improvements
- Documentation clarifications

## Reporting

### Weekly Reports

Generate weekly reports including:

1. Total issues reported
2. Issues resolved
3. Average resolution time
4. Common issue categories
5. Recommendations for improvement

### Monthly Analysis

Conduct monthly analysis to identify:

1. Recurring issues that need permanent fixes
2. Feature requests to consider for roadmap
3. Sellers requiring additional training or support
4. Support team performance metrics

## Integration with Other Tools

### Slack Integration

- Use the #seller-support channel for real-time updates
- Format for escalations: `[ESCALATION] [Issue Type] - Brief Description (Seller Name)`

### ClickUp Integration

- Create tasks for technical issues that require development work
- Link the ClickUp task ID in the tracker for reference

## Best Practices

1. **Be Thorough**: Document all details, even if they seem minor
2. **Be Timely**: Update the tracker in real-time, not at the end of the day
3. **Be Consistent**: Use standard terminology and formats
4. **Follow Up**: Check back with sellers after marking issues as resolved
5. **Look for Patterns**: Identify recurring issues that might indicate larger problems
