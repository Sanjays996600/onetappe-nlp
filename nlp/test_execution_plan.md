# Test Execution Plan for NLP Command System

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive test execution plan for the multilingual NLP command system. It defines the testing approach, schedule, resource allocation, and execution procedures to ensure thorough validation of the system's functionality, performance, and reliability. This plan covers all testing phases from unit testing to user acceptance testing and provides guidelines for test execution, reporting, and issue management.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Validate Functionality**: Ensure the NLP command system correctly recognizes intents, extracts entities, routes commands, and generates appropriate responses in all supported languages
2. **Verify Performance**: Confirm the system meets performance requirements under various load conditions
3. **Ensure Reliability**: Validate system stability and error handling capabilities
4. **Validate Multilingual Support**: Verify the system works correctly with all supported languages
5. **Identify Defects**: Discover and document defects early in the development cycle

### Specific Objectives

1. Define test execution strategy for each testing phase
2. Establish test execution schedule aligned with development milestones
3. Define roles and responsibilities for test execution
4. Establish procedures for test execution, reporting, and issue management

Defect ID: DEF-123
Title: Intent recognition fails for complex Hindi commands
Reported By: Jane Smith
Reported Date: 2023-05-15
Severity: Medium
Priority: High
Status: New

Description:
Intent recognition fails when processing complex Hindi commands with multiple entities.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Send the Hindi command "मुझे पिछले हफ्ते के शीर्ष 10 उत्पादों की बिक्री दिखाएं" (Show me sales of top 10 products from last week)
2. Observe the response

Expected Result:
Command should be recognized with intent "get_top_products" and entities for limit (10) and time_period (last_week)

Actual Result:
Command is recognized with intent "unknown" and no entities are extracted

Environment:
- Testing environment
- API version 1.2.3
- Hindi language model version 1.0.1

Attachments:
- Screenshot of API response
- Log file showing error

Possible Cause:
The Hindi language model may not be properly handling complex sentence structures with multiple entities.
```
