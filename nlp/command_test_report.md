# WhatsApp Command Parser + NLP Testing Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing of core commands in both English and Hindi for the WhatsApp Command Parser + NLP module. The testing covers accuracy, time parsing, and error handling for the following commands:

- `edit_stock`
- `get_orders`
- `get_report`
- `get_low_stock`
- `search_product`

## Test Methodology

1. **Command Accuracy Testing**: Each command was tested with multiple variations in both English and Hindi to verify correct intent recognition and entity extraction.

2. **Time Parsing Verification**: Commands with time-related parameters (like `get_orders` and `get_report`) were tested with various time expressions (today, yesterday, last week, etc.) in both languages.

3. **Error Handling**: Edge cases and potential error scenarios were tested to ensure the system responds appropriately.

4. **Intent Routing Confirmation**: Verified that each recognized intent is correctly routed to the appropriate backend service.

## NLP Command Response Accuracy Matrix

| Command | English | Hindi |
|---------|---------|-------|
| edit_stock | 0/4 (0.0%) FAIL | 0/4 (0.0%) FAIL |
| get_orders | 2/4 (50.0%) FAIL | 4/4 (100.0%) PASS |
| get_report | 2/4 (50.0%) FAIL | 3/4 (75.0%) FAIL |
| get_low_stock | 3/4 (75.0%) FAIL | 3/4 (75.0%) FAIL |
| search_product | 4/4 (100.0%) PASS | 3/4 (75.0%) FAIL |

## Parsed Output Examples

### English Examples

#### GET_ORDERS

{
  "intent": "get_orders",
  "entities": {
    "range": "all"
  },
  "language": "en"
}
```

#### GET_REPORT
```json
{
  "intent": "get_report",
  "entities": {},
  "language": "en"
}
```

#### GET_LOW_STOCK

{
  "intent": "get_low_stock",
  "entities": {
    "threshold": 5
  },
  "language": "en"
}
```

#### SEARCH_PRODUCT
```json
{
  "intent": "search_product",
  "entities": {
    "name": "sugar"
  },
  "language": "en"
}
```

### Hindi Examples

#### GET_ORDERS

{
  "intent": "get_orders",
  "entities": {
    "range": "all"
  },
  "language": "hi"
}
```

#### GET_REPORT
```json
{
  "intent": "get_report",
  "entities": {},
  "language": "hi"
}
```

#### GET_LOW_STOCK
```json
{
  "intent": "get_low_stock",
  "entities": {
    "threshold": 5
  },
  "language": "hi"
}
```

#### SEARCH_PRODUCT
```json
{
  "intent": "search_product",
  "entities": {
    "name": "चीनी"
  },
  "language": "hi"
}
```

## Intent Routing Confirmation

| Intent | Routing Status |
|--------|---------------|
| edit_stock | ❌ Not Confirmed |
| get_orders | ✅ Confirmed |
| get_report | ✅ Confirmed |
| get_low_stock | ✅ Confirmed |
| search_product | ✅ Confirmed |

## Time Parsing Analysis

### English Time Expressions
- Today: Successfully parsed in `get_report` command
- Yesterday: Successfully parsed in `get_orders` command
- Last week: Successfully parsed in `get_orders` command
- Last month: Not consistently recognized
- This month: Not consistently recognized

### Hindi Time Expressions
- आज (Today): Successfully parsed in `get_report` command
- कल (Yesterday): Successfully parsed in `get_orders` command
- पिछले हफ्ते (Last week): Successfully parsed in both `get_orders` and `get_report` commands
- पिछले महीने (Last month): Not consistently recognized
- इस महीने (This month): Not consistently recognized

## Error Handling Verification

| Scenario | English Response | Hindi Response |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Unknown product | Appropriate error message | Appropriate error message |
| Invalid quantity | Not properly handled | Not properly handled |
| Ambiguous time range | Not properly handled | Not properly handled |
| No matching products | Appropriate error message | Appropriate error message |

## Recommendations

1. **Improve `edit_stock` Command Recognition**: Both English and Hindi versions of the `edit_stock` command have 0% accuracy. The pattern matching needs to be completely revised to recognize various ways users might express stock updates.

2. **Enhance Time Range Parsing**: The system struggles with certain time expressions, especially for monthly reports. Improve the regex patterns to better capture these expressions.

3. **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling across all commands and languages, especially for invalid quantities and ambiguous time ranges.

4. **Improve English `get_orders` Recognition**: While Hindi performs well (100%), English only achieves 50% accuracy. Review and update the English patterns for this intent.

5. **Enhance Hindi Support for `search_product`**: While English achieves 100% accuracy, Hindi is at 75%. Expand the Hindi patterns to cover more variations.

6. **Add Unit Tests for Edge Cases**: Create additional tests for edge cases in both languages to ensure robust handling of unusual inputs.

## Conclusion

The WhatsApp Command Parser + NLP module shows varying levels of accuracy across different commands and languages. While some commands like `search_product` in English and `get_orders` in Hindi perform well with 100% accuracy, others like `edit_stock` in both languages need significant improvement.

Hindi language support is generally good, with `get_orders` achieving perfect accuracy and other commands reaching 75% accuracy. However, English command recognition is more inconsistent, ranging from 0% to 100% accuracy depending on the command.

Intent routing to backend services works correctly for all successfully recognized intents, confirming that the command router functions properly once an intent is identified.

Implementing the recommendations above would significantly improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the NLP system, particularly for the problematic `edit_stock` command and for time-based queries in both languages.
