# NLP Command System Performance Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the NLP command system, focusing on response time, throughput, and reliability under various load conditions.

## Performance Testing Goals

1. **Response Time**: Measure and optimize the time taken to process commands and return responses
2. **Throughput**: Determine the maximum number of commands the system can handle per unit time
3. **Reliability**: Ensure the system maintains accuracy and stability under load
4. **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage during operation

## Test Environment

### Hardware Requirements
- Test server specifications (CPU, RAM, disk space)
- Network configuration
- Client machine specifications

### Software Requirements
- Operating system version
- Python version
- Required libraries and dependencies
- Monitoring tools

## Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Average Response Time | Time from command submission to response receipt | < 500ms |
| 95th Percentile Response Time | Response time for 95% of requests | < 1000ms |
| Maximum Response Time | Worst-case response time | < 2000ms |
| Throughput | Commands processed per second | > 10 commands/second |
| Error Rate | Percentage of failed commands | < 1% |
| CPU Utilization | Percentage of CPU used during peak load | < 70% |
| Memory Usage | RAM consumption during peak load | < 500MB |

        threads = []

            threads.append(t)
            t.start()
        
        for t in threads:
            t.join()
        
        return self.analyze_results()
    
    def analyze_results(self):
        response_times = [r["response_time"] for r in self.results]
        success_rate = sum(1 for r in self.results if r["success"]) / len(self.results)
        
        return {
            "total_commands": len(self.results),
