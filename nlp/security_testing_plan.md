        mock_send.return_value = {"success": True, "code_id": "test_code_id"}
        
        # Send verification code
        self.auth_handler.send_verification_code("+919876543210")
        
        # Fast-forward time (mock)
        self.auth_handler._verification_expiry["test_code_id"] = 0
        
        # Verify code
        result = self.auth_handler.verify_code("test_code_id", "123456")

        # Verify that phone number is encrypted
        self.assertNotEqual(stored_data["phone_number"], user_data["phone_number"])
        
        # Verify that data can be decrypted correctly
        decrypted_data = self.data_handler.get_user_data(stored_data["user_id"])
        self.assertEqual(decrypted_data["phone_number"], user_data["phone_number"])

        # Access user data
        self.data_handler.get_user_data(user_id)
        
        # Verify that access was logged
        logs = self.data_handler.get_access_logs()
        self.assertGreaterEqual(len(logs), 1)
        self.assertEqual(logs[-1]["user_id"], user_id)
        self.assertEqual(logs[-1]["action"], "get_user_data")
```

## Security Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Integration with CI/CD

Security testing should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that security issues are identified early in the development process.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for security testing
name: Security Testing

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  security-testing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install bandit safety pytest-security
    
    - name: Run SAST with Bandit
      run: bandit -r ./nlp -f json -o bandit-results.json
    
    - name: Check dependencies with Safety
      run: safety check -r requirements.txt --json > safety-results.json
    
    - name: Run security unit tests
      run: pytest -xvs tests/security/
    
    - name: Upload security test results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: security-test-results
        path: |
          bandit-results.json
          safety-results.json
```

### 2. Security Gates

Implement security gates in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent the deployment of code with security vulnerabilities.

- **Build Gate**: Fail the build if high-severity vulnerabilities are found in SAST or dependency scanning
- **Deployment Gate**: Require security approval before deploying to production
- **Monitoring Gate**: Monitor for security issues in production and roll back if necessary

## Security Testing Scenarios
